# Common questions/fixes:
**Script not automatically executing itself**
- Put the script in automatic-execution folder in your executor, means your crappy executor has a crappy `queue_on_teleport` function.
**It shows 4 chests collected in debug data but there are barely any items collected**
- Check your inventory for x999 on common items, items are auto-sold when they reach max capacity.
**Script only does Sukuna boss, how to choose another boss?**
- Execute the script inside an actual boss fight instead of main game
**Why are there so many maintenances?**
- I'm bored and feel like fucking with something
**How to use the script during maintenance?**
- Copy down the source code at http://stingray-digital.online/script/jji and run the script from source instead of from loadstring, you must have the script copied down before maintenance happens in order to use it!
**How to setup Webhook?**
- Tutorial here, replace `https://yourdiscordwebhook.com` with webhook copied from: https://gyazo.com/c779b31b07ca5b11b61ef5de74892980
**Is the script safe to use?**
- Script is relatively safe compared to any other script you find online, all leveling, pvp and gamepass scripts are a guaranteed ban. If you use this and only this script on an account, you are pretty safe from the auto detection, however I can't guarantee anything if admins look through logs and find your account suspicious.
**How to get script**
- Go to https://discord.com/channels/1329069699920560200/1329767516268134472/1329767547360251968 or use /pray on Dogbot in <#1329193000408186940> to get a key for the script
**Script so slow**
- Ensure you have a decent black flash build, here's [recommended stat tree,](https://discord.com/channels/1329069699920560200/1329086236144697395/1331398319401992213) health and technique are both unnecessary.
